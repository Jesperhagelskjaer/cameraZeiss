Metting 8/8 -2017 (Jesper + Kim)
--------------------------------

New functionality for GenericAlgo.

1. Adjust laser intensity

A function can be turned on that decreases the laser intensity in a configurable step,
whenever a number of specified pixels are saturated (255) within the specified area computing the cost function.

Default Values for new Parameters:
NUM_SATURATION 	= 1
LASER_STEP  	= 0.1

Intensity is logged in the data file and printed on screen.


2. Genectic algorithm - probability computaion

Compute the probability when performing a random mutation according to forumla below:
probablility = (Rstart - Rend)*exp(-n/lambda) + Rend

Default values for new Parameters:
RSTART = 400
REND   = 100
LAMBDA = 1.0
MUT_PROBABILITY(n)  = ( (RSTART - REND)*exp(-n/LAMBDA) + REND )

n is incremented for every new offspring generation


3. Generate new random templates

For a configurated number of iterations a number of templates with the lowest cost is replaced 
with new random generated templates.

Default Values for new Parameters:
NUM_RAN_ITERATIONS = 100
NUM_RAN_TEMPLATES  = 10


4. New cost function

A new cost function has to be calculated as the relation between a cost of area around a local maximum outside the area 
of computing the old intensity cost. 
A maximum intensity is found outside cost area and cost is computed in the same way as computing the cost in 
It should be possible to choose between new and old cost calculation.

new cost = old cost / cost for area around local maximum intensity

Default Values for new Parameters:
COST_FUNCTION   =  1


5. New function to genetic algorithm
The probability should be higher picking af random template of high cost relative to one with low cost

Default Values for new Parameters:
RAND_PROPABILITY = 1  - logistic probability distribution
